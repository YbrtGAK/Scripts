	abstract = {This paper is a literature review covering various aspects of two-phase flow patterns. After a description of commonly observed flow regimes in horizontal and vertical pipes, some different types of flow pattern maps are discussed. Experimental techniques for direct and indirect determination of flow regimes are reviewed. These include direct viewing, photography, X-ray and statistical analysis of fluctuations in measured pressure or void fraction which yield power spectral density and probability density functions. The recent advances in the use of neutron noise analysis are also discussed. Flow regime transition criteria based on correlations and theoretical derivations are covered next. Finally, the effects of wall roughness, heat flux and flow acceleration on flow regime transitions are discussed. Throughout the paper an attempt has been made to identify the areas where new development work is needed.},

	abstract = {There is a disagreement in the reports on flow boiling heat transfer on the dependence of the local heat transfer coefficient on local vapour quality, mass and heat flux and system pressure. As a consequence, various conclusions were reported about the dominant heat transfer mechanism(s) in small to microdiameter tubes. Yet, the reasons behind this large disagreement are not clear. The current study investigated experimentally two important parameters that may contribute in explaining the scatter in the published heat transfer results. The first parameter is the tube inner surface characteristics and the second is the length of the heated section. The surface effect was experimentally investigated through examining two stainless steel tubes manufactured by two different methods. The first tube is a seamless cold drawn tube whilst the second is a welded tube. The two tubes have similar design and dimensions and were investigated at 8bar system pressure and 300kg/m2s mass flux. The inner surface of the two tubes was examined using a scanning electron microscope ({SEM}) and was found to be completely different. The heat transfer results demonstrated that the trend of the local heat transfer coefficient versus local vapour quality in the seamless cold drawn tube is completely different from that in the welded tube. Three heated lengths were investigated for a seamless cold drawn tube with an inner diameter of 1.1mm over a wide range of experimental conditions; mass flux range of 200–500kg/m2s, system pressure of 6–10bar, inlet sub-cooling value of about 5K and exit quality up to about 0.95. The results indicated that the heated length influences strongly the magnitude as well as the local behaviour of the heat transfer coefficient. There is a progression from nucleate boiling to convective boiling as the heated length increases. The variation in the heat transfer coefficient due to differences in the heated length may also influence the performance of the existing microscale heat transfer correlations. The flow patterns observed at the exit of each test section are also presented.},

	abstract = {The inner surfaces of microtubes may be influenced strongly by the process of making them due to manufacturing difficulties at these scales compared to larger ones, e.g. the surface characteristics of a seamless cold drawn tube may differ from those of a welded tube. Accordingly, flow boiling heat transfer characteristics may vary. In addition, there is no common agreement between researchers on the criteria of selecting tubes for flow boiling experiments. Instead, tubes are usually ordered from commercial suppliers, in many cases without taking into consideration the manufacturing method and its effect on the heat transfer process. This may explain some of the discrepancies in heat transfer characteristics which are found in the open literature. This paper presents a comparison between experimental flow boiling heat transfer results obtained using two different metallic tubes. The first one is a seamless cold drawn stainless steel tube of 1.1mm inner diameter while the second is a welded stainless steel tube of 1.16mm inner diameter. Both tubes have a heated length of 150mm and the flow direction is vertically upwards. The tubes were heated using {DC} current. Other experimental conditions include: 8bar system pressure, 300kg/m2s mass flux, about 5K inlet sub-cooling and up to 0.9 exit quality. The results are presented in the form of local heat transfer coefficient versus local quality and axial distance. Also, the boiling curves of the two tubes are discussed. The results show a significant effect of tube inner surface morphology on the heat transfer characteristics.},

	abstract = {The influence of surface roughness on flow boiling heat transfer and pressure drop in microchannels is experimentally explored. The microchannel heat sink employed in the study consists of ten parallel, 25.4 mm long channels with nominal dimensions of 500×500 μm2. The channels were produced by saw-cutting. Two of the test piece surfaces were roughened to varying degrees with electrical discharge machining ({EDM}). The roughness average Ra varied from 1.4 μm for the as-fabricated, saw-cut surface to 3.9 μm and 6.7 μm for the two roughened {EDM} surfaces. Deionized water was used as the working fluid. The experiments indicate that the surface roughness has little influence on boiling incipience and only a minor impact on saturated boiling heat transfer coefficients at lower heat fluxes. For wall heat fluxes above 1500 {kW}/m2, the two {EDM} surfaces (3.9 μm and 6.7 μm) have similar heat transfer coefficients that were 20–35\% higher than those measured for the saw-cut surface (1.4 μm). A modified Bertsch et al. [2009, “A Composite Heat Transfer Correlation for Saturated Flow Boiling in Small Channels,” Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer, 52, pp. 2110–2118] correlation was found to provide acceptable predictions of the flow boiling heat transfer coefficient over the range of conditions tested. Analysis of the pressure drop measurements indicates that only the roughest surface (6.7 μm) has an adverse effect on the two-phase pressure drop.},

	abstract = {Understanding the influence of surface characteristics on flow boiling heat transfer behavior in microgap is necessary to enhance the performance of microgap heat sink. The influences of surface roughness on flow boiling heat transfer, pressure drop and instability in microgap heat sink are experimentally investigated. Flow boiling experiments are conducted over silicon microgap heat sink of three different microgap dimensions namely 500μm, 300μm and 200μm. The original silicon surface of surface roughness, Ra=0.6μm is modified to Ra=1.0μm and 1.6μm to examine the effect of surface finish. These studies are carried out with the inlet deionized water temperatures 91°C at two different mass fluxes, G=390kg/m2s and 650kg/m2s and imposed effective heat flux, qeff″ ranging from 0W/cm2 to 85W/cm2. High speed flow visualizations are conducted simultaneously along with experiments to explore the bubble behavior in microgap heat sink. The results of this study show that bubble nucleation site density as well as heat transfer coefficient increases with the increase of surface roughness and pressure drop is independent of surface roughness in microgap heat sink. Moreover, rougher surface maintains lower and uniform wall temperature over the heated surface. However, surface roughness has an adverse effect on the inlet pressure instability and inlet pressure fluctuation increases with increasing surface roughness at larger microgap heat sink.},

The tube surfaces were compared using scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) and surface data acquired from confocal laser microscopy ({CFLM}), both showing differences between the surfaces. The heat transfer coefficient is similar in magnitude for all three materials but with a slight variation in trend. The heat transfer coefficient is seen to peak at high vapour qualities for stainless steel and brass, which is less evident with copper. The results were compared with past heat transfer correlations. These results showed better agreement with stainless steel compared to copper and brass. The pressure drop was shown to differ with surface characteristics, with the pressure drop for brass having a much steeper increase with heat flux. The pressure drop correlations tested did not show good agreement with the experimental results.},

	abstract = {Roughness features on the walls of a channel wall affect the pressure drop of a fluid flowing through that channel. This roughness effect can be described by (i) flow area constriction and (ii) increase in the wall shear stress. Replotting the Moody’s friction factor chart with the constricted flow diameter results in a simplified plot and yields a single asymptotic value of friction factor for relative roughness values of ε∕D\&gt;0.03 in the fully developed turbulent region. After reviewing the literature, three new roughness parameters are proposed (maximum profile peak height Rp, mean spacing of profile irregularities {RSm}, and floor distance to mean line Fp). Three additional parameters are presented to consider the localized hydraulic diameter variation (maximum, minimum, and average) in future work. The roughness ε is then defined as Rp+Fp. This definition yields the same value of roughness as obtained from the sand-grain roughness [H. Darcy, Recherches Experimentales Relatives au Mouvement de L’Eau dans les Tuyaux (Mallet-Bachelier, Paris, France, 1857); J. T. Fanning, A Practical Treatise on Hydraulic and Water Supply Engineering (Van Nostrand, New York, 1877, revised ed. 1886); J. Nikuradse, “Laws of flow in rough pipes” [“Stromungsgesetze in Rauen Rohren,” {VDI}-Forschungsheft 361 (1933)]; Beilage zu “Forschung auf dem Gebiete des Ingenieurwesens,” Ausgabe B Band 4, English translation {NACA} Tech. Mem. 1292 (1937)]. Specific experiments are conducted using parallel sawtooth ridge elements, placed normal to the flow direction, in aligned and offset configurations in a 10.03mm wide rectangular channel with variable gap (resulting hydraulic diameters of 325μm–1819μm with Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 7200 for air and 200 to 5700 for water). The use of constricted flow diameter extends the applicability of the laminar friction factor equations to relative roughness values (sawtooth height) up to 14\%. In the turbulent region, the aligned and offset roughness arrangements yield different results indicating a need to further characterize the surface features. The laminar to turbulent transition is also seen to occur at lower Reynolds numbers with an increase in the relative roughness.},
